We have published a new paper on sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs). It provides operational definitions for four different notions of SMCs that have not previously been distinguished. The paper illustrates these using a minimal cognition model and hypothesises about their link to personal-level concepts fundamental to the sensorimotor approach, such as the mastery of sensorimotor skills.
