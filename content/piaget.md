Our new paper on sensorimotor contingencies is out. It tackles what seems like a paradox in the sensorimotor approach: if understanding is required for perception, how can we learn to perceive something new, something we do not yet understand? We propose a Piagetian solution to this problem, according to which we learn to perceive by re-shaping pre-existing sensorimotor structures (the earliest of which are already present at birth) in coupling with dynamical regularities of the world.
